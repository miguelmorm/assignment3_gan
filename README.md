Assignment 3 – GAN (PyTorch) + FastAPI + Docker
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch, served via a FastAPI web application, and containerized using Docker.
It includes endpoints to train the GAN and generate synthetic images, as well as a health check and auto-generated API documentation.

⚙️ Requirements
Install dependencies locally (recommended inside a virtual environment)
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, build and run with Docker
# Build the image
docker build -t sps-gan:latest .

# Run the container
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 sps-gan:latest
This command runs the FastAPI app inside a Docker container and exposes it at port 8000.

🧠 Part 2 – Model Deployment with MNIST (GAN Integration)
In Part 2 of this assignment, the GAN model was expanded and integrated with the MNIST dataset to demonstrate the full pipeline of training, generation, and deployment through FastAPI.
🎯 Objective
The goal was to train a GAN capable of generating realistic hand-written digits using the MNIST dataset, and to make it accessible through the existing API endpoints.
This part also required extending the helper library modules developed in previous modules to support the new training and generation workflow.
⚙️ Technical Implementation
Dataset: MNIST (60 000 hand-written digit images – 28×28 grayscale)
Architecture: Two neural networks – Generator and Discriminator – trained adversarially.
Training: Implemented in PyTorch with BCE loss and Adam optimizers.
Endpoints Integrated:
/train_gan – Trains the GAN on MNIST for a user-defined number of epochs.
/generate_gan – Generates synthetic hand-written digits using the trained generator.
Helper Library Enhancements:
model.py – Defines and returns the Generator and Discriminator through get_model().
trainer.py – Implements train_gan() to load MNIST, train the model, and save checkpoints and sample grids.
generator.py – Adds functions to generate and save images from latent noise vectors.
🧩 How It Works
Train the model – Send a POST request to /train_gan.
The API downloads the MNIST dataset, trains both networks, and saves checkpoints under /checkpoints.
Generate images – Send a POST request to /generate_gan.
This loads the latest Generator weights and produces a grid of synthetic digits at /outputs/generated_grid.png.
Visualization – All images are normalized to [–1, 1] and saved as 28×28 grayscale samples for evaluation.
🧪 Expected Outcome
After training, the GAN produces realistic MNIST-style digits that can be visualized via the generated grid.
The Generator successfully learns to map random noise vectors to digit-like patterns through adversarial learning.
